      "The Loop Trolley was a 2.2-mile (3.5 km), 10-station heritage streetcar line in St. Louis, Missouri. It operated from November 2018 to December 2019. As of December 2019, the Bi-State Development Agency, a regional transit operator, was seeking ways to restart operations.Opened in November 2018, the Loop Trolley connected the Delmar Loop district and the Missouri History Museum in Forest Park, serving parts of University City and the St. Louis neighborhoods of DeBaliviere Place, Skinker/DeBaliviere, and the West End. It also served two MetroLink light-rail stations: Delmar Loop and Forest Park–DeBaliviere.At its closing, the line operated from noon until 6 p.m. on Thursdays through Sundays. Passengers were carried on two replica-historic streetcars.The Loop Trolley Transportation Development District owns the line and trolley cars, which were operated by the non-profit Loop Trolley Company. Operating funds came from a one-cent sales tax collected by businesses along and near the line, and from fares and advertising.Ridership was far lower than expected, and the trolley ceased operations on December 29, 2019.\n"
